# firefoxTest
This is the test of google sign up in firefox browser, which is based on Ruby, Capybara  and RSpec. 
Unfortunately, my tests were failed because Xpath locator does not work properly.
It actually does not find anything. If someone has solved this problem, please tell my what`s wrong.

Test cases
In my test file firefoxTest_spec.rb I tried to test basic visiting of https://accounts.google.com/signup
and filling in all inputs by finding their id.
To run test you should clone this projects and run firefoxTest_spec.rb
